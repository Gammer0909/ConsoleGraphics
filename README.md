# ConsoleGraphics

  ConsoleGraphics is a Simple Graphics library to make Titles and squares.
  
  # Quickstart
   Currently there is no .dlls for downloading, so simply copy + paste the namespaces into your code. 
   
   If you wish to use the namespaces in another file, use this: https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/objects-and-methods/namespaces-and-file-structure
